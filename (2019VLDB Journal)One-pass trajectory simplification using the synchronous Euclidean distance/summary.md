This paper introduces two algorithms using synchronous Euclidean distance(SED) which hasn't been used for one-pass line simplification(LS) algorithm, because these algorithms can't support spatiotemporal queries. These algorithms called Cone Intersection using the Synchronous Euclidean Distance(CISED-S) and (CISED-W) are strong and weak simplification respectively using SED. LS algorithms using SED typically generate more line segments, since the distance between a point to a segment using SED is less than using PED. To utilize the sector intersection mechanism on algorithm designed for PED, this paper propose the algorithm using SED creatively.
1. Sector intersection-based algorithm using PED uesd on 2D Cartesian coordinate system is to part the trajectory into several subtrajectories through judging whether the intersection of sectors contrain data points other than the start point. 
2. Intersection computation of convex polygons is to judge whether two convex have the intersecting places. This algorithm is to replace the algorithm judging the intersecting on two circles, since the algorithm on circles has high complexity. This algorithm runs like that the segments in each convex cycle their polygons to judge whether they have intersecting. There is also a speedup inscribed regular polygon intersection algorithm utilizing the relation between two convex's segments' serial number to decide how many steps segments can advance.
3. Spatiotemporal cone intersection extends the sector intersection method from a 2D space to a spatiotemporal 3D space. From the start point to the end point, this algorithm defines several cones, and these points belong the same subjectory if and only if their cones at the end point's plane have the intersecting.
4. The difference between CISED-S and CISED-W is that they have different threshold and CISED-W has the interpolation not like CISED-S which produces points all from original trajectory.

The algorithm CISED-S and CISED-W are fast and have good compression ratios compared with baseline such as SQUISH-E and DPSED. I gain much more than before from this paper, and this paper helps me clear almost classical algorithms as well as advanced approaches.

Experiment: 1. Baseline methods. 2. Change parameters.
