4. The algorithm Persistence Algorithm with beta Pruning resolve the data which is changed into angle information from coordinate system. The minima and the maxima are the key information through the whole algorithm. a component is a data structure holding a start and end index in the trajectory, respective angle function values, and a flag whether this component is finished.For every minima, this approach sets a component initialized to start at this minimum. And then starting this loop, the method extends the point which is from unfinished components both left and right to find a smaller angle. When this smaller angle is a local maximum, current component will be merged with other component if it is from another component, otherwise, current component will be closed for another merging. Finally if the size of the component is bounded by beta, this component will be removed.
5. The algorithm mentioned above does not work very well, when the trajectories are part of longer persistent structures. Not only did this paper use simple distance pruning, but also beta-pruning. This paper then introduces the updated algorithm called SDS. This algorithm replace the spatial pruning rule with a triangle rule which is to judge whether the distance between a given point and the segment which is from the predecessor and successor of this point.
6. This paper also propose a method to measure two trajectories' length. It uses the quotient between two Frechet distances. Frechet distance is discribed with minimize the maximum distance.
