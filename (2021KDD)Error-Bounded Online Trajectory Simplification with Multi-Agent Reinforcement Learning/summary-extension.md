3. Direction-Aware Distance(DAD) is a approach to measure a trajecotry whether it is straight enough. An angle is made by two segments which are the segment from start point to end point and the segment between two adjacent points inner the subjectory. The aim is to find the max angle from from them.
4. In the algorithm MARL4TS, a trajectory is inputted and a simplified trajectory T' is outputted. The aim of this algorithm is to drop as many as points. This approach uses a window to maintain safe points. For the incoming point, judging whether the loss of the window is bounded by the given threshold can seperate the cases into two until the last point comes. In a case, we can expand the window by j when loss is smaller than threshold. In the other case, we can open another window starting from one of the last k points when loss exceeds the threshold. The parameters k and j are produced from the Deep-Q-Network(DQN). This method uses the idea from the Markov decision process having four features called states, actions, transitions, rewards. About the rewards, Agent-E and Agent-R share the same parameter rewards because the aims of them are to drop points. J and K are the maximum of j and k respectively. The reinforcement learning DQN is to choose the best j and k to gain the biggest reward.
